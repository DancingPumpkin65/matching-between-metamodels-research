# Matching Between Metamodels Research  

This repository explores matching algorithms between metamodels, focusing on:  
- Implementation of similarity algorithms.  
- Evaluation of quality metrics (recall, precision, F-measure).  
- Detailed analysis and explanation of approaches used.  

## Algorithms and Approaches  

### 1. **Similarity Calculation**  
- **Simhash:** Used for approximate matching based on hash values of text features.  
- **Cosine Similarity:** Computes the cosine of the angle between two high-dimensional vectors (e.g., embeddings from `sentence-transformers`).  

### 2. **Natural Language Processing Techniques**  
- **Tokenization, Lemmatization, and Stopword Removal:** Prepares text data for similarity analysis using `nltk`.  
- **Embedding Generation:** Utilizes pre-trained models from `sentence-transformers` and `transformers` (e.g., BERT) to generate sentence embeddings.  

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** Evaluates the quality of matching algorithms based on their output compared to the ground truth.  
  - Libraries: `sklearn.metrics`
